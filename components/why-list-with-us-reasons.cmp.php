                    <h3>Harisbenzz Market Experts</h3>
                        <p>
                        Uganda may seem small if you’ve lived here, 
                        but when you’re trying to sell a house, even the little 
                        details can make a big impact. Working with an Harisbenzz 
                        gives you access to in depth knowledge of the different 
                        neighborhoods. This allows us to be able 
                        to give you the most precise price estimate and appraisal for 
                        your home’s value compared to the other homes for sale in the 
                        area, put it on the market at the correct time, and find a buyer
                         who will love your home as much as you do.

                        <p>
                        When our sellers list with us, they are provided with maximum 
                        exposure of their homes to all of the potential buyers that are 
                        current residents or new migrants to the country. We utilize own <a href="<?php $url?>listing">listings</a> 
                        page to list your 
                         home. Our team at Harisbenzz will always take 
                         professional and beautiful photos when we’re listing your home 
                         online. We also take advantage of social media to spread the word 
                         about your home. We take marketing your home seriously, because even 
                         the most beautiful home that is priced just right won’t sell if home 
                         buyers don’t know it’s out there. Contact us so we can keep you 
                         updated on the latest real estate activities in our community and answer any 
                         questions you may have.
